# 🐧 LINUX TERMINAL – QUICK REVISION NOTES ( Day 1 )

---

## ✅ 1. BASIC NAVIGATION COMMANDS

- `pwd` → Show current directory (Print Working Directory)  
- `ls` → List files and folders in current directory  
- `cd folder_name` → Change directory to "folder_name"  
- `cd ..` → Move one level up  
- `cd ~` → Go to home directory  
- `cd /` → Go to root directory  

---

## 📁 2. CREATING DIRECTORIES (FOLDERS)

- `mkdir foldername` → Create a new folder  
- `mkdir folder1 folder2` → Create multiple folders at once  

**Example:**
```bash
mkdir Linux-Commands  
mkdir new_fold  
cd new_fold  
mkdir miran 
```

---

## 📄 3. CREATING FILES

- `touch filename.txt` → Create an empty file  
- `touch file1.txt file2.txt` → Create multiple empty files at once  

---

## 📂 4. LISTING CONTENTS

- `ls` → List files and folders in current directory  
- `ls -l` → Long listing format (permissions, size, timestamps)  

---

## 📌 5. PATHS IN LINUX

### What is a Path?
> A path is the address of a file or folder in the filesystem.

### Absolute Path
- Starts from the root directory `/`
- Full location from root  

**Examples:**
- `/Users/miran/Desktop`  
- `/etc/samba/smb.conf`  

### Relative Path
- Based on your current location (`pwd`)  
- Does **not** start with `/`  

**Examples:**
- `Desktop/`  
- `../Documents/`  
- `./file.txt`  

---

## ⚠️ 6. COMMON ERRORS FACED

- `cd /root` → ❌ No such file or directory (macOS doesn't have `/root`)  
- `cd /user/miran` → ❌ Typo — should be `/Users/miran` (capital "U")  

✅ **Correct usage:**  
- `cd /Users/miran`  

---

## 📝 7. EXAMPLE TERMINAL SESSION (WHAT YOU DID)

```bash
cd /Users/miran/Desktop  
mkdir Linux-Commands  
mkdir new_fold  
cd new_fold  
mkdir miran 
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt  
ls
```

**Output:**  
```
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt  miran  
```
